# VRCML-AntiKick

I feel very sorry for releasing this module, but the current implementation of the votekick system inside VRC is horrible, and insanely easy to abuse so in the current state i consider it an **Anti-Feature** which needs to be disabled until VRC devs implement it properly and then they can also patch this module by just dropping the connection from the server once a kick has been issued.

This module is standalone and prevents you from being votekicked. It's main intention is **NOT** for you to run around and troll but for you to continue conversations when hackers try to fuck you up.

If you manage to find someone using this plugin abusively please just block and ignore that person (Don't feed trolls)
